# Speech to Text Model
 This model is a sophisticated speech-to-text system designed to accurately transcribe spoken English into written text. It has been developed using the Python programming language.
The Turkish version of this speech-to-text model has also been added, expanding its capabilities to better support a wider range of languages and enhancing its accessibility for users who speak Turkish.
